Notes:
1. not sure if dealer should auto-stand at 17, so i've auto hit till 17, then given user option if to hit or stand
2. not sure if cards are dealt first or if players put bet first, for now its get cards and then bet - easy enough to reverse
3. Some more notes are listed around the code as comments
4. Code is easy enough to read, used 4 classes, Shoe - holds the cards , Player - for a player incl. dealer with id -1(the game Blackjack treats dealer special way) , Hand - every player can have 1 or 2 hands (if has split)
5. Code is more like a Java equivalent (Had only 1 day to learn ruby , so haven't been able to use most of the ruby specific paradigm) 
6. Can easily implement additional features like Player walking away ,etc
